"""Application settings.

All configuration comes from the environment (twelve-factor); nothing is
read from files at runtime. `GLASSHOUSE_MORPHOLOG_BIN` points at the
morpholog binary in development (the commit zone's `GlasshouseClient`
honours the same name); in the Docker image the binary is baked in at a
known path.
